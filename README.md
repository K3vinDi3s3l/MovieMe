# PROJECT TITLE
- Project 1: MovieMe

# CONCEPT 
- Description 
    - MovieMe allows users to search for movie suggestions based on their input of one of their favorite movie titles into our search page.  
    The user will be provided with a listing of eight movies to explore.  Once the user selects a movie that interests them the application 
    will provide the user details (Title, Release Date, Rating, Runtime, Genre, Plot, Director, Critic Scores and youtube trailers).

- Motivation for development? 
    - With everyone restricted to stay at home undoubtably more people are turning to watching movies to pass the time.  
    This application will help people figure out what to watch.

- User story
    - As a site visitor, I want to search for movie recommendations based on movies I like, so I go to MovieMe to get 
    movie suggestions and find out more about those movies to save me browsing time.

# CHALLENGES
- Working remotely made things more difficult on several fronts.
    - Collaboration was time consuming.
    - Connectivity issues led to inability to communicate.
    - Work was duplicated.
- APIs did not always work as expected or described.
    - Requirements for query encoding varied between services.
    - Documentation was sometimes behind the existing deployment.
    - Planned inclusion of Twitter API had to be scrapped.
- Framework had less flexibility than Bootstrap
    - Helper classes like margin and padding are not built in
    - Containers had one fixed size and weren’t responsive.
    - Columns did not always behave as expected.

# SUCCESSES
- Teamwork and clearly defined roles increased productivity.
- Target milestones and goals were often met or exceeded before the due date.
- Strong communication and engagement allowed for rapid adjustment when challenges arose.
- Reaching completion of MVP ahead of schedule allowed for implementation of stretch goals like saved search history and additional content

# FUTURE DEVELOPMENT
- Add social media feed related to movie selected.
- Genres based searches using previous searches.
- History of previously selected items in content page.
- Links to the review sites listed for each movie.
